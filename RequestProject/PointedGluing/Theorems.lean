**Corollary (Pgluingofraysasupperbound).**
For any continuous `f : A → B` in 𝒞 and any `y ∈ B`,
`f ≤ pgl_{i ∈ ℕ} Ray(f, y, i)`.

## Section 4: CB Regularity for Simple Functions (Proposition 3.8)
-/


/-- **Proposition (CBrankofPgluingofregularsequence2simple).**
If `f ∈ 𝒞` is scattered of CB-rank `α + 1` and simple with distinguished point `y`,
then the sequence `(CB(Ray(f, y, n)))_n` is regular with supremum `α`.


The proof shows: by simplicity, `CB_α(f) ⊆ f⁻¹({y})`, so
`CB_α(Ray(f, y, i)) = ∅`, giving each `α_i ≤ α`. For regularity: if `∀ n > m`,
`α_n ≤ β < α`, then restricting `f` away from the first `m` rays gives
`CB(g) ≤ β + 1 ≤ α`, and the disjoint union decomposition contradicts
`CB(f) = α + 1`.

Note: `Continuous f` is required for the CB-level analysis of ray restrictions.
In the paper, all functions are in 𝒞 (continuous functions on the Baire space).

Error in manuscript: It is possible that $\alpha$ is limit
and $(\CB(\ray{f}{y,n}))=\alpha$ for only finitely many $n$,
in which case the conclusion fails. This proposition is really
about simple functions with double successors rank

## Section 5: Maximum and Minimum Functions (Propositions 3.9 and 3.12)
-/



/-! **Proposition (Maxfunctions). Maximum functions.**
For all `α < ω₁`:
1. There exists a function `ℓ_α` that is a maximum of `𝒞_{≤α}`:
   every scattered function with CB-rank `≤ α` reduces to `ℓ_α`.
2. `pgl ℓ_α` is a maximum for simple functions in `𝒞_{≤α+1}`.
3. For all `n ∈ ℕ`, `(n+1) · k_{α+1}` is a maximum among functions of
  CB-type `(α+1, n+1)` with compact domains.
The proof is by strong induction on `α`:
- For the first item, use the Decomposition Lemma to write `f` as locally simple,
  then apply the induction hypothesis (item 2) and Gluingasupperbound.
- For the second item, use Pgluingofraysasupperbound: `f ≤ pgl_j Ray(f, y, j)`,
  and each ray has CB-rank `≤ α`, so `Ray(f, y, j) ≤ ℓ_α` by item 1.
- For the third item, induction on `n` using the compact domain structure.

The function `MaxFun α = ℓ_α` (the identity on `MaxDom α`, see Definition 3.5) is
a maximum of `𝒞_{≤α}`: every scattered function with CB-rank at most `α` continuously
reduces to `MaxFun α`.

The proof is by strong induction on `α`:
- Use the Decomposition Lemma to write `f` as locally simple, then apply
  the induction hypothesis and `Gluingasupperbound`.
- For the second item (simple functions), use `Pgluingofraysasupperbound`.
- For the third item (compact domains), double induction on `n`.
- items 1 and 2 are proved simultaneuously in maxFun_is_maximum
- I do not think item 3 is used later, skipping it for now

PROVIDED SOLUTION
For all $\alpha<\omega_1$:
1. the function $\Maximalfct{\alpha}$ (MaxFun α) is a maximum of $\sC_{\leq\alpha}$,
2. the function $\pgl \Maximalfct{\alpha}$ (SuccMaxFun α) is a maximum for simple functions in $\sC_{\leq \alpha+1}$,

First notice that if $\alpha\leq \beta$, then we have $\Maximalfct{\alpha}\leq\Maximalfct{\beta}$ and
$\Minimalfct{\alpha+1}\leq\Minimalfct{\beta+1}$ by MaxFun_monotone and MinFun_monotone.
For $\alpha=0$, we have $\Maximalfct{0}=\emptyset$ and $\Minimalfct{1}=\pgl\Maximalfct{0}=\id_{\set{\iw{0}}}\equiv\id_{\set{0}}$,
so all items follows from \cref{LocallyConstantFunctions} (theorem constant_equiv_id_singleton).

We prove the two items simultaneously by strong induction on $\alpha$: suppose they both hold for all $\beta<\alpha$.
To see that $\Maximalfct{\alpha}$ is a maximum in $\sC_{\leq\alpha}$, let $f\in\sC$ with $\CB(f)\leq\alpha$.
By the decomposition_lemma_baire \cref{JSLdecompositionlemma},
$f$ is locally simple. If $\alpha$, is limit $f=\bigsqcup_i f_i$ with $f_i$ simple
and $\CB(f_i)=\beta_i+1<\alpha$ and so by induction hypothesis the second item ensures that $f_i\leq \pgl \Maximalfct{\beta_i}\leq \Maximalfct{\beta_i+1}$.
If $\alpha$ is successor, $f=\bigsqcup_i f_i$ with $f_i$ simple and $\CB(f_i)=\beta+1=\alpha$ and
again the induction hypothesis implies that $f_i\leq \pgl \Maximalfct{\beta}$.
In both, cases we get $\gl_{i}f_i\leq \Maximalfct{\alpha}$ and so $f\leq \Maximalfct{\alpha}$
by gluingFun_upper_bound_backward.

Now take $f$ simple in $\sC_{\leq \alpha+1}$ and call $y$ its distinguished point.
By pointedGluing_rays_upper_bound we have $f\leq\pgl_{j\in\N}\ray{f}{y,j}$, but by simplicity of $f$
we also have $\CB(\ray{f}{y,j})\leq\alpha$ for all $j\in\N$. As $\Maximalfct{\alpha}$ is a maximum
in $\sC_{\alpha}$, we get $\ray{f}{y,j}\leq\Maximalfct{\alpha}$ for all $j\in \N$ and
so $f\leq \pgl\Maximalfct{\alpha}$ by \cref{Pgluingasupperbound}.

SEE maxFun_is_maximum' in MaxFunMaximum.lean for the formal statement and full proof.

/-! **Proposition (Minfunctions). Minimum functions.**
For all `α < ω₁`, there exists a function `k_{α+1}` that is minimum in `𝒞_{≥α+1}`:
for all `f ∈ 𝒞` with `CB(f) ≥ α + 1`, we have `k_{α+1} ≤ f`.


The proof is by strong induction on `α`:
- For `α = 0`, `k_1 ≡ id_1` reduces to any nonempty function.
- For successor `α = β + 1`, use Pgluingaslowerbound2: find a ray of CB-rank `α`
  in any neighborhood of a CB_α-point, and apply the induction hypothesis.
- For limit `α`, similarly find rays of growing CB-rank using regularity.

## Section 6: Pointed Gluing as a Lower Bound (Lemma 3.10, Proposition 3.11)
-/


/-! **Lemma (Pgluingaslowerbound).**
Let `f : A → B` be a function between metrizable spaces and `(g_n)_n` a sequence in 𝒞.
If there is a point `x ∈ A` and a sequence `(A_n)_n` of clopen sets satisfying:
1. `f(x) ∉ cl(f(A_n))` for all `n`,
2. The sets `f(A_n)` form a relative clopen partition,
3. `A_n → x` (sets converge to `x`),
4. `g_n ≤ f|_{A_n}` for all `n`,
then `pgl_n g_n ≤ f`.

/-! **Proposition (Pgluingaslowerbound2). Pointed gluing as lower bound.**
Let `f : A → B` be continuous in 𝒞 and `(g_i)_i` a sequence in 𝒞.
If for all `i ∈ ℕ` and all open neighborhoods `U ∋ x`, there is a continuous
reduction `(σ, τ)` from `g_i` to `f` with `im(σ) ⊆ U` and
`f(x) ∉ cl(im(f ∘ σ))`, then `pgl_i g_i ≤ f`.


In fact, `pgl_i g_i ≤ f|_V` for all clopen neighborhoods `V` of `x`.

-/


/-- **Theorem (Compactdomains). Classification of functions with compact domains.**
If `f` and `g` are in 𝒞 with compact domains, then `f ≤ g` iff
`tp(f) ≤_{lex} tp(g)`, where `tp(f) = (CB(f), deg(f))` is the CB-type.


More specifically, `f ≡ (n+1) · k_{α+1}` where `tp(f) = (α+1, n+1)`.
In particular, continuous reducibility is a pre-well-order of length `ω₁` on
functions in 𝒞 with compact domain.


The proof follows from Maxfunctions and Minfunctions: the minimum function `k_{α+1}`
reduces to any `f` with `CB(f) ≥ α + 1` (by Minfunctions), and any `f` with compact
domain reduces to `(n+1) · k_{α+1}` (by Maxfunctions item 3). -/

/-- **Proposition (FGgivesBQO_2).**
If `𝒞_β` is 2-BQO for all `β < α`, then `𝒞_{<α}` is 2-BQO.


The proof defines the partial order `≤•` on ordinals by
`α₀ ≤• α₁ iff α₀ = α₁ or 2α₀ < α₁`.
This 2nLTm defined in Bqo.2nLTmIsTwoBQO.
This is a BQO (as a sum of copies of `(ℕ, ≤•)` along the limit ordinals).
The General Structure Theorem shows that the map `f ↦ (CB(f), f)` into the
`≤•`-indexed sum of levels is a co-homomorphism for continuous reducibility.
Since a co-homomorphic image of a BQO is BQO, `𝒞_{<α}` is BQO.


In particular, if each level is finitely generated (Theorem 1.3), then
`𝒞` is BQO (Theorems 1.4 and 1.5). -/

/-- Any bad pair-sequence in ScatFun has all its CB-ranks bounded below ω₁,
    and restricts to one concentrated on a single level β.
    Sketch
    we define a partial order $\leq^\bullet$ on $\omega_1$ by $\alpha_0\leq^\bullet \alpha_1$ if and only if $\alpha_0=\alpha_1$ or $2\alpha_0<\alpha_1$
    As any ordinal $\alpha$ can be uniquely written as $\alpha=\lambda+n$ with $\lambda$ limit or null and $n\in\N$ and $2\alpha=\lambda+2n$, we have:
    $\lambda_0+n_0 \leq^\bullet \lambda_1+n_1 \Lglra \lambda_0<\lambda_1\mbox{ or } \bigl(\lambda_0=\lambda_1\mbox{ and } n_0\leq^\bullet n_1 \bigr).$
    This partial order is the sum of the BQO 2nLTm along ω_1, so it is 2-BQO by TwoBQO.lexSigma

    Then the proof follows roughly TwoBQO.lexSigma (which could be generalized to a sum along a 2-BQO `partial` order, antisymmetry is crucial),
    let fr = fun m n => CBRank f m n
    by composing with a StrictMono this function is
    either strictly increasing for the version of 2nLTm on omega1.
      but then f is good by the general structure theorem
    or constant equal to some ordinal β, as desired.

/-! **Corollary (ConsequencesGeneralStructureThm) — Item 1.**
If `(f_n)_n` is in `𝒞_{<λ}` for `λ` limit, then `pgl_n f_n ≤ k_{λ+1}`.
If moreover `(CB(f_n))_n` is regular with `sup_n CB(f_n) = λ`,
then `pgl_n f_n ≡ k_{λ+1}`.


The proof uses the General Structure Theorem to find `2 · CB(f_n) ≤ α_{k_n}`
for a cofinal sequence, giving `f_n ≤ k_{α_{k_n}+1}`.
Then Pgluingasupperbound gives `pgl_n f_n ≤ k_{λ+1}`.
If `(CB(f_n))_n` is regular, then `CB(pgl_n f_n) = λ + 1` by
Proposition (CBrankofPgluingofregularsequence1), and `k_{λ+1}` being minimum
gives the reverse.
