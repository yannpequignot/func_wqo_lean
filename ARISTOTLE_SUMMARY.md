## Summary of Changes

This project formalizes a research memoir on continuous reducibility between functions — a deep area of descriptive set theory. The project contains ~53 `sorry` statements representing the core theorems of this multi-chapter memoir, including results about well-quasi-orders, Cantor-Bendixson analysis, pointed gluings, centered functions, wedge operations, and the precise structure theorem.

### What was accomplished:

1. **`RequestProject/PrelimMemo/Gluing.lean`** — Fixed 4 incomplete proofs (`exact?` calls) in the locally constant function theory:
   - `locally_constant_infinite_image_forward`: Fixed the continuity proof for the restricted codomain map (used `continuous_of_discreteTopology` since ℕ has discrete topology)
   - `id_nat_reduces_locally_constant`: Fixed three proof goals:
     - Existence of countable dense subset (used `SeparableSpace.exists_countable_dense`)
     - Locally constant function has constant open neighborhoods (used `IsLocallyConstant.isOpen_fiber_`)
     - Continuity of σ : ℕ → X (used `continuous_of_discreteTopology`)
     - Continuity of restricted τ on discrete range (used `continuous_of_discreteTopology`)

2. **`RequestProject/IntroMemo.lean`** — Decomposed `scatteredIffEmptyKernel` into structured helper lemmas:
   - **`perfectKernel_eq_compl`** (fully proved): Shows the perfect kernel equals the complement of the locally constant locus, since the locally constant locus is open (hence its complement is the smallest closed set containing itself)
   - **`locallyConstantLocus_univ_imp_scattered`** (fully proved): The backward direction — if every point is locally constant, then f is scattered
   - **`scattered_imp_locallyConstantLocus_univ`** (sorry): The forward direction — if f is scattered, continuous, X metrizable, Y T₂, then every point is locally constant. This is the mathematically deep direction requiring careful use of metrizability and sequential arguments.
   - **`scatteredIffEmptyKernel`** (now uses the helpers): The main theorem now follows directly from the three helper lemmas above, with only the forward direction remaining as a sorry.

### What remains:

The vast majority of remaining `sorry` statements are deep results from the research memoir:
- **IntroMemo.lean**: Main Theorems 1-3 (WQO results), `scattered_imp_locallyConstantLocus_univ`
- **PrelimMemo/Scattered.lean**: Sierpiński's theorem, first reduction theorem, clopen basis lemma, decomposition lemma
- **PrelimMemo/Gluing.lean**: `gluingFun_upper_bound_backward`
- **PointedGluing/Theorems.lean**: 14 theorems about pointed gluings, CB-rank analysis, max/min functions, general structure theorem
- **CenteredMemo/Theorems.lean**: 9 theorems about centered functions, cocenters, rigidity
- **PreciseStructMemo/Theorems.lean**: 21 theorems about wedge operations, finite generation, precise structure theorem

These are genuinely deep research-level results that form the mathematical content of a multi-chapter memoir on continuous reducibility. Each requires substantial mathematical infrastructure and proof techniques (transfinite induction, Cantor-Bendixson analysis, BQO theory, etc.) that go beyond what can be automated.

## Formalization of `5_precise_struct_memo.tex` — Precise Structure

I created two new Lean files formalizing the main theorems from Chapter 5 of the memoir on continuous reducibility:

### `RequestProject/PreciseStructMemo/Defs.lean` — Definitions (0 sorries)

Contains all core definitions from Chapter 5:
- **`WedgeFun`** — the wedge operation `⋁(f₀, …, fₖ | f_{k+1})`, the third and final operation on functions introduced in Chapter 5
- **`WedgeDomComponent`** / **`WedgeDom`** — domain of the wedge
- **`IsDominatedBy`** / **`DominationEquiv`** — domination order on sets of functions
- **`InScatteredClass`**, **`InCBLevel`**, **`InCBLevelLE`**, **`InCBLevelLT`**, **`InCBLevelInterval`** — predicates for CB-rank level membership
- **`FiniteGeneration`** — the statement FG(α): every function in 𝒞_α is continuously equivalent to a finite gluing of generators
- **`FiniteGeneration_below`** / **`FiniteGeneration_le`** — FG(<α) and FG(≤α)
- **`OmegaFun`** — the omega operation ω f

### `RequestProject/PreciseStructMemo/Theorems.lean` — Theorems (20 statements, 1 fully proved)

Contains formalizations of 20 main results from Chapter 5, organized into three sections:

**Proved:**
- `wedge_not_injective` (Fact 5.3, Item 2) — The wedge is not injective when k > 0

**Stated (with sorry):**
- *Wedge operation properties:* `wedge_preserves_continuity`, `wedge_CBrank`, `wedge_upper_bound`, `wedge_domination_equiv`, `disjointification_lemma`
- *Finite generation at successors of limits:* `infiniteEmbedOmegaStronger`, `intertwine_reductions`, `intertwine_reductions_omega_centered`, `omega_centered_to_component`, `maxFun_limit_to_component`, `diagonal_for_lambda_plus_one`, `FG_at_successor_of_limit`
- *Generators and the Precise Structure Theorem:* `alreadyKnownGenerators_1`, `generators_finite`, **`preciseStructureThm`** (the main result: 𝒞_α is finitely generated for every α < ω₁), `FG_base_cases`, `FG_implies_FG_succ_limit`, `FG_le_implies_interval_gen`, `FG_below_implies_bqo`, `FG_below_implies_locally_centered`, `FG_below_centered_classification`

Both files compile successfully and build on the existing project infrastructure (definitions from Chapters 1–4).
