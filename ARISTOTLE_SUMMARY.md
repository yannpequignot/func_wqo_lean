## Mathlib Style Improvements

Successfully applied comprehensive Mathlib-standard code quality improvements across all 44+ Lean files in the project. The full build passes with no new warnings.

### Key Changes

1. **Localized `set_option maxHeartbeats`** (highest-impact change):
   - Removed global `set_option maxHeartbeats` from all 44 files.
   - Only 11 specific declarations across 5 files actually needed elevated heartbeats — the rest compile fine with defaults.
   - Each necessary `set_option maxHeartbeats N in` is now placed directly before the declaration that requires it, following Mathlib convention.

2. **Spacing normalization** (730 lines across 33 files):
   - Removed spaces inside parentheses: `( fun x => ...)` → `(fun x => ...)`
   - Removed spaces inside brackets: `[ arg1, arg2 ]` → `[arg1, arg2]`

3. **Documentation improvements** (153 comments converted):
   - Added `/-! ... -/` module docstrings to all files that were missing them (`Main.lean`, `SelfSimilarity.lean`, `Blackboard.lean`)
   - Converted 153 block comments (`/- ... -/`) preceding declarations to proper doc comments (`/-- ... -/`)

4. **Whitespace cleanup**:
   - Removed trailing whitespace from 65 lines
   - Normalized trailing newlines (all files end with exactly one newline)

### What Was Already Done (by previous work)
- CamelCase file naming, deprecated tactic migration (`refine'` → `refine`), `exact?` removal, unused variable fixes, `set_option relaxedAutoImplicit false` removal, and other cleanup as documented in `STYLE_GUIDE.md`.

### Remaining Lower-Priority Items
- ~540 lines exceed the 100-character line length limit, mostly in complex tactic proofs where breaking up would require careful proof restructuring.

The updated `STYLE_GUIDE.md` documents all changes comprehensively.

## Modular Refactoring Summary

Successfully refactored the 3 largest files in the project into a modular structure, splitting them into 8 focused sub-files. All changes compile successfully with no new `sorry` statements introduced.

### Files Split

#### 1. `PrelimMemo/Gluing.lean` (845 lines → 3 sub-files + re-export)
- **`PrelimMemo/Gluing/Defs.lean`** (279 lines) — Core definitions: `IsDisjointUnion`, `IsRelativeClopenPartition`, `prepend`/`unprepend`, `GluingSet`, `GluingFunVal`, plus the continuity-of-union theorems and the gluing identity lemma.
- **`PrelimMemo/Gluing/UpperBound.lean`** (339 lines) — Gluing as upper/lower bound (Proposition 2.17): `gluingFun_upper_bound_forward/backward`, `continuous_prepend/unprepend`, `continuous_pasting_on_clopen`, `disjoint_union_reduces_gluing`, and piecewise continuity helpers.
- **`PrelimMemo/Gluing/LocallyConstant.lean`** (276 lines) — Locally constant functions (Proposition 2.24): `constant_equiv_id_singleton`, `locally_constant_infinite_image`, plus the finite generation section (commented-out BQO theorem) and `exists_infinite_discrete_subspace`.
- **`PrelimMemo/Gluing.lean`** (13 lines) — Re-export file that imports all three sub-modules, preserving backward compatibility for all downstream imports.

#### 2. `PointedGluing/GeneralStructureHelpers.lean` (400 lines → 3 sub-files + re-export)
- **`GeneralStructureHelpers/Functoriality.lean`** (196 lines) — Pointed gluing functoriality: `pgs_reconstruct`, `pgl_fun_mem`, `pgl_tau_continuousOn`, `pgl_functorial_val`, `omega_pgl_le_pgl_pgl`.
- **`GeneralStructureHelpers/OrdinalArithmetic.lean`** (60 lines) — Ordinal decomposition helpers: `limit_add_nat_lt`, `ordinal_limit_nat_decomposition`, `cofinalSeq_eventually_ge`.
- **`GeneralStructureHelpers/GluingInjection.lean`** (202 lines) — Successor step and gluing injection: `MaxFun_le_MinFun_succ`, `gluing_reduces_to_pgluing_via_injection` with all its sigma/tau continuity helpers.
- **`GeneralStructureHelpers.lean`** (13 lines) — Re-export file.

#### 3. `PointedGluing/MaxFunLimitRank.lean` (700 lines → 2 sub-files + re-export)
- **`MaxFunLimitRank/ClopenRestriction.lean`** (211 lines) — `gClopenDom`/`gClopenFun` definitions and their properties, plus `gluing_via_codomain_partition` (the blockwise reduction lemma).
- **`MaxFunLimitRank/TreeArgument.lean`** (524 lines) — The full tree argument: `TreeT`, `cbRankRestr`, prefix-closure, `gClopenFun_CBRank_eq`, and `exists_disjoint_clopen_with_cofinal_ranks`.
- **`MaxFunLimitRank.lean`** (11 lines) — Re-export file.

### Import Minimization
- The original `PrelimMemo/Gluing.lean` imported `Bqo.TwoBQO` which was only needed for a commented-out BQO theorem. The split files no longer carry this import, reducing unnecessary transitive dependencies.
- Added the necessary `import RequestProject.Bqo.TwoBQO` directly to `PointedGluing/Theorems.lean` where `PairSeq`/`BadPairSeq` are actually used, rather than carrying it through the entire gluing import chain.
- Removed `import Mathlib` from `PrelimMemo/Gluing/UpperBound.lean` (was added temporarily during debugging, confirmed unnecessary).

### Proof Fixes
- Replaced fragile `grind +locals` / `grind` calls in `gluingFun_upper_bound_forward` with explicit `subst`-based proofs that handle dependent-type rewrites correctly and are stable across both LSP and `lake build` environments.

## Mathlib Style Compliance — Changes Made

The project has been updated to more closely follow Mathlib coding standards. All changes compile successfully.

### Key changes:

1. **File naming (CamelCase)**:
   - Renamed `MaxMinhelpers.lean` → `MaxMinHelpers.lean`
   - Renamed `blackboard.lean` → `Blackboard.lean`

2. **Migrated all `refine'` to `refine`** (228 instances across 25 files):
   - Replaced `_` goal placeholders with `?_` as required by `refine`
   - Restructured several non-trivial proof patterns that relied on `refine'` semantics:
     - `Continuous.congr`/`ContinuousOn.congr` + `use` patterns → explicit `(f := ...)` or `apply` + `pick_goal`
     - Made existential witnesses explicit where inference failed
     - Provided explicit arguments in recursive calls where metavariable unification didn't work

3. **Removed `set_option relaxedAutoImplicit false`** from all 38 files (redundant — it's the default in Lean 4.28.0)

4. **Removed all trailing semicolons** (44 remaining instances)

5. **Fixed angle bracket spacing** (`⟨ x, y ⟩` → `⟨x, y⟩`)

6. **Cleaned up banner-style comments** (`-- ════════════`, `-- ── Title ──────`) replaced with simpler section markers

### Remaining items (documented in `STYLE_GUIDE.md`):
- ~45 unused simp argument warnings (require manual investigation per-instance)
- ~600 lines exceeding 100-character limit
- Extra whitespace in tactic expressions (`( fun ...`, `[ arg ]`)
- Global `set_option maxHeartbeats` (should be localized per-declaration)

## Fixed all sorries in Case B of `exists_disjoint_clopen_with_cofinal_ranks`

The file `RequestProject/PointedGluing/MaxFunLimitRank.lean` now builds successfully with no remaining `sorry` statements in Case B.

### What was proved

The theorem `exists_disjoint_clopen_with_cofinal_ranks` establishes that given a scattered continuous function `g : B → ℕ → ℕ` with CB-rank `η` (a limit ordinal), for any sequence `δ` with `δ n < η`, there exist pairwise disjoint clopen sets `C n` and an injection `p` such that `δ n < CBRank(g|C(p n))`.

**Case B** handles the situation where the body of the tree T (the set of infinite paths through T) is finite. The proof proceeds in several steps:

1. **Cofinality (`hCofinal`)**: For any `β < η`, there exists a "frontier node" (a finite sequence not in T whose parent is in T) with CB-rank > β. This is proved by contradiction: if all frontier nodes had rank ≤ β, then every point in `CBLevel g (succ β)` would map into the finite bodyT, making `g` locally constant on that CB-level, forcing `CBLevel g (succ (succ β)) = ∅` and `CBRank g ≤ succ (succ β) < η`, a contradiction.

2. **Sequence construction**: Using `hCofinal`, an inductive sequence of frontier nodes is built with strictly increasing CB-ranks, ensuring each `δ i` is exceeded. Strictly increasing ranks guarantee distinct nodes.

3. **Incompatibility**: Distinct frontier nodes are shown to be pairwise incomparable (no prefix relation) via `TreeT_prefix_closed`: if one frontier node were a prefix of another with strictly shorter length, it would be a prefix of the other's parent (which is in T), and by prefix-closure of T, it would itself be in T — contradicting its frontier status.

### Helper lemmas added

- `CBLevel_succ_succ_empty_of_finite_image`: If all points in `CBLevel g (succ β)` map into a finite set, then `CBLevel g (succ (succ β)) = ∅`.
- `CBLevel_empty_of_le_rank`: If `CBRank f ≤ β` for a scattered function, then `CBLevel f β = ∅`.
- `not_mem_CBLevel_of_open_restrict_empty`: Points in an open set with empty restricted CB-level are not in the ambient CB-level.

# Summary of changes for run 173ad7a9-0ed4-4d38-8a32-d438ead97caa
Fixed the proof of `exists_disjoint_clopen_with_cofinal_ranks` (Case A) in `RequestProject/PointedGluing/MaxFunLimitRank.lean` by properly using `infinite_baire_antichain_prefixes`.

**Changes made:**

1. **`RequestProject/PointedGluing/MaxFunLimitRankHelpers.lean`**: Added and proved `discreteTopology_image_val` — a helper lemma showing that discrete topology transfers through `Subtype.val`: if `S` is a discrete subset of `↥A` (a subtype of `X`), then `Subtype.val '' S` is a discrete subset of `X`.

2. **`RequestProject/PointedGluing/MaxFunLimitRank.lean`** (Case A of `exists_disjoint_clopen_with_cofinal_ranks`):
   - Replaced the two `sorry`s in Case A with a complete proof.
   - The proof maps the discrete subset `S` of `bodyT` to `S' := Subtype.val '' S` (a discrete subset of `ℕ → ℕ`) using `discreteTopology_image_val`.
   - Applies `infinite_baire_antichain_prefixes` to an injection `ℕ → ↥S'` to obtain an antichain `seq` of finite prefixes.
   - Shows each `seq i` satisfies `T_prop` because it's a prefix of some element in `S' ⊆ bodyT`, and all truncations of bodyT elements are in T.
   - Concludes by taking `C n := BaNbhd (seq n).2` with `p := id`, using the antichain's incomparability for disjointness and `T_prop` (giving `CBRank = η > δ n`) for the cofinal rank condition.

3. **Renamed `MaxMinhelpers.lean` → `MaxMinHelpers.lean`**: Fixed a case-sensitivity issue (lowercase 'h') that caused build failures on Linux but would work on macOS.

**Remaining sorries**: The Case B sorries (`hCofinal` and the sequence construction) in `exists_disjoint_clopen_with_cofinal_ranks` were pre-existing and not part of this fix request. Both modified files build successfully.

## Code Quality Improvements — Mathlib Standards

The project builds successfully with all changes. No `sorry`s were added or removed — only code quality improvements were made.

### Changes Made

**Bug fixes:**
- Fixed typo `NowhereLocllyConstant` → `NowhereLocallyConstant` in `PrelimMemo/Scattered/CBAnalysis.lean` and `NonScattered.lean`

**File naming (Mathlib CamelCase convention):**
- `PointedGluing/MaxMinhelpers.lean` → `MaxMinHelpers.lean`
- `PrelimMemo/blackboard.lean` → `Blackboard.lean`
- Updated all import statements in affected files

**Replaced `exact?` with actual proof terms (6 files):**
- `ClopenPartitionReduces.lean`: `exact isLindelof_univ`
- `GeneralStructureHelpers.lean`: `exact List.map_inj.mp rfl`
- `MaxFunMaximum.lean`: `exact Homeomorph.continuous (subtypeInterHomeo A U)` and `expose_names; exact ...`
- `GeneralStructure.lean`: `intro; simp [gRestrFun]`
- `SelfSimilarity.lean`: removed trailing `--exact?;` comment

**Fixed 124 unused variable warnings** by prefixing with `_` across 24 files.

**Fixed 6 unused section variable warnings** by adding `omit [...] in` in `MinFunHelpers.lean`.

**Fixed linter warnings:**
- 3 unused simp arguments in `GeneralStructure.lean`, `MaxFunLimitRank.lean`, `CBRankHelpers.lean`
- `simpa` → `simp` in `PointedGluingUpperBound/UpperBound.lean`
- `<;>` → `;` in `MaxFunMaximum.lean` where only one goal existed
- Merged consecutive `intro` calls in `MinFunHelpers.lean`

**Formatting (project-wide):**
- Removed ~1,916 trailing semicolons from tactic lines (Mathlib convention)
- Fixed ~476 instances of extra whitespace in angle brackets (`⟨ x, y ⟩` → `⟨x, y⟩`)

**Documentation:**
- Added module docstrings (`/-! ... -/`) to 5 files missing them
- Added definition docstrings (`/-- ... -/`) to 8 definitions in `Defs.lean` and `MaxFunLimitRank.lean`
- Cleaned up `Main.lean` (removed excessive `set_option` and pretty-printing options)

### Warning reduction
- **Before:** 181 non-sorry warnings
- **After:** 45 non-sorry warnings (all are unused simp argument false positives that would break proofs if removed)

### Remaining issues
See `STYLE_GUIDE.md` for a detailed list of remaining lower-priority issues:
- 45 unused simp argument warnings (tricky false positives)
- 224 uses of deprecated `refine'` (needs `_` → `?_` migration)
- ~600 lines exceeding 100-character limit
- Global `set_option maxHeartbeats` (should be localized)
- Redundant `set_option relaxedAutoImplicit false` (now default)

## Progress on resolving sorries in `MaxFunLimitRank.lean`

### What was accomplished

**Starting state**: 5 sorries in `exists_disjoint_clopen_with_cofinal_ranks`, split across:
- Case A (bodyT infinite): 3 sorries in a **buggy** antichain construction (the N-definition was mathematically incorrect — it only bounded separation for j < i, not j > i)
- Case B (bodyT finite): 2 sorries for cofinality argument and sequence construction

**Case A — Fixed (modulo 1 helper sorry)**:
- Identified and diagnosed the bug in the original N-based antichain construction
- Created a new helper file `RequestProject/PointedGluing/MaxFunLimitRankHelpers.lean` with a decomposed approach to the antichain construction
- Proved 5 helper lemmas fully:
  - `nat_range_infinite_or_fiber_infinite` — pigeonhole principle for ℕ → ℕ
  - `injective_subseq_of_infinite_range` — injective subsequence extraction
  - `const_subseq_of_infinite_fiber` — constant subsequence extraction  
  - `branching_level_antichain` — antichain from a branching level (Case 1)
  - `orphan_antichain` — antichain from orphan extraction (Case 2)
- Restructured Case A in `MaxFunLimitRank.lean` to use `infinite_baire_antichain_prefixes` from the helper file, with clean proof that T_prop holds for each antichain element
- **1 sorry remains**: `infinite_baire_antichain_prefixes` — the main combinatorial lemma stating that an injective function ℕ → Baire space yields an infinite antichain of finite truncations. The proof structure (case split into branching vs orphan extraction) is set up with all sub-lemmas proved; the remaining difficulty is the iterative chain construction (building nested subsequences by induction and extracting orphans).

**Case B — Unchanged (2 sorries remain)**:
- `hCofinal` (line 432): The cofinality argument requiring CB level analysis
- Sequence construction (line 454): Building pairwise incomparable nodes with cofinal ranks from hCofinal

### Current state
- **3 genuine sorries** remain (down from 5 buggy ones), all in `exists_disjoint_clopen_with_cofinal_ranks`
- Line 460 contains `-- or sorry` which is just a **comment**, not an actual sorry
- Both files build successfully
- The `gluing_via_codomain_partition` theorem (proved in the previous session) remains fully proved

### Files modified/created
- `RequestProject/PointedGluing/MaxFunLimitRank.lean` — Added import of helper file; rewrote Case A with correct construction
- `RequestProject/PointedGluing/MaxFunLimitRankHelpers.lean` — **New file** with 5 proved helper lemmas and 1 remaining sorry for the main antichain construction

## Progress on `MaxFunLimitRank.lean`

### Sorries Resolved This Session

1. **`gluing_via_codomain_partition`** — **Fully proved** (was the first of two top-level sorry'd theorems). This is the key lemma for the limit ordinal case: it shows that if each block of the MaxDom gluing reduces to `gClopenFun B g (C (p n))` via disjoint codomain clopens, then `MaxFun η` reduces to `g`. The proof was decomposed into:
   - **`gluingSet_unprepend_mem`** — proved that `unprepend x.val ∈ A (x.val 0)` for `x ∈ GluingSet A`
   - **`gluingSet_blockwise_sigma_cont`** — proved that the block-wise σ map on a GluingSet is continuous (using clopen block partition and ContinuousAt analysis)
   - **`gluingSet_blockwise_reduces`** — proved the core combining lemma: if each block of a GluingSet reduces to `g` with images in disjoint clopens `C(p n)`, then the entire GluingSet reduces to `g`. Uses `extract_B_map` for decomposition, `continuousOn_piecewise_clopen` for τ continuity, and disjointness for unique block recovery.
   - The main theorem then follows by rewriting `MaxDom η` as a `GluingSet` (via `MaxDom_limit`) and applying the above.

2. **Cleaned up `CBLevel_comp_homeomorph`** — replaced `exact?` with the explicit proof `exact CBLevel_homeomorph φ f _`.

### Remaining Sorries (5, all within `exists_disjoint_clopen_with_cofinal_ranks`)

These are all internal to the second top-level theorem and fall into two groups:

**Case A (bodyT infinite) — 3 sorries (lines 489, 494, 497):**
The antichain construction has a known bug in the definition of `N` (truncation length). The definition `N(i) = 1 + sup_{j < i} sep(i, j)` only accounts for paths with index `j < i`, but incomparability for the `i < j` direction requires `sep(i, j) < N(i)`, which isn't guaranteed. The comments in the code document this issue and suggest fixes (symmetric N definition or subsequence extraction), but implementing the fix would require a substantial rewrite of the entire Case A block.

**Case B (bodyT finite) — 2 sorries (lines 531, 553):**
- `hCofinal` (line 531): The cofinality argument requires showing that if bodyT is finite, then for any β < η, there exists a BaNbhd node with rank strictly between β and η. This needs infrastructure about how CBRank decomposes over disjoint clopen partitions.
- Sequence construction (line 553): Building the antichain sequence from the cofinality result.

### Build Status
The file compiles successfully with sorry warnings only in `exists_disjoint_clopen_with_cofinal_ranks`.

## Summary of Changes to `RequestProject/PointedGluing/MaxFunLimitRank.lean`

### Sorries Resolved (5 out of 11 original sorries)

1. **`gClopenFun_CBRank_eq`** — Fully proved. The key insight is that `gClopenFun B g C` and `fun x : {b : B | g b ∈ C} => g x.val` are the same function up to a homeomorphism of domains. This was proved by:
   - Adding `CBLevel_comp_homeomorph`: CBLevel is preserved under precomposition with a homeomorphism (proved by transfinite induction)
   - Adding `CBRank_comp_homeomorph`: CBRank equality follows from CBLevel equality
   - Adding `gClopenDomEquiv`: explicit homeomorphism between the two domain types
   - Adding `gClopenFun_eq_comp`: expressing gClopenFun as a composition with the homeomorphism

2. **`hsep_sym` (symmetry of separation point)** — Fixed. The inner proof was correct but not connected to the outer `sorry`. Removed the redundant inner `have` and used the proof directly.

3. **`hle` (Finset.sup bound)** — Proved using `Finset.le_sup` with `dif_pos`.

4. **`hrank_eq` in Case A** — Replaced `sorry` with `gClopenFun_CBRank_eq (BaNbhd (seq n).2) (BaNbhd_isClopen _)`.

5. **Final rank comparison in Case B** — Replaced `sorry` with `gClopenFun_CBRank_eq` and `hseq_cofinal`.

### New Helper Lemmas Added

- `CBLevel_comp_homeomorph` — CBLevel is invariant under precomposition with a homeomorphism
- `CBRank_comp_homeomorph` — CBRank is invariant under precomposition with a homeomorphism
- `gClopenDomEquiv` — Homeomorphism between `{b : B | g b ∈ C}` and `gClopenDom B g C`
- `gClopenFun_eq_comp` — `gClopenFun` equals a composition through the homeomorphism
- `piece_reduces_to_g` — Each piece of the MaxDom gluing reduces to g (via transitivity)

### Remaining Sorries (6)

1. **`gluing_via_codomain_partition`** (line 73) — Requires constructing a global continuous reduction from the GluingSet structure of MaxDom for limit ordinals, combining piece-wise reductions through disjoint codomain partitions.

2. **`hkey` + two case splits** (lines 373, 378, 381) — The antichain construction in Case A has a known issue: the definition of `N` (truncation length) only accounts for `j < i`, but the proof of `¬IsPrefix` for `i < j` requires `sep(i,j) < N(i)`, which isn't guaranteed. The comments in the code document this issue and suggest a fix (using a symmetric definition of N or extracting a subsequence), but the fix is not yet implemented.

3. **`hCofinal`** (line 415) — The cofinality argument for Case B: showing that if bodyT is finite, then for any β < η, there exists a BaNbhd node with rank strictly between β and η.

4. **Sequence construction** (line 437) — Constructing the antichain sequence in Case B from the cofinality result.

### Build Status
The file compiles successfully with `sorry` warnings only in `gluing_via_codomain_partition` and `exists_disjoint_clopen_with_cofinal_ranks`.

## Summary of work on `MaxFun_le_limit_rank`

### What was accomplished

The proof of `MaxFun_le_limit_rank` in `PointedGluing/GeneralStructure.lean` has been **fully structured** — the original `sorry` in `MaxFun_le_limit_rank` has been eliminated and replaced with a complete proof that chains through two well-defined helper lemmas. The `general_structure_theorem` now compiles without any `sorry` in `GeneralStructure.lean`.

**Architecture created:**

1. **`PointedGluing/MaxFunLimitRank.lean`** (new file) — Contains the infrastructure for the limit rank argument:
   - `gClopenDom` / `gClopenFun` — Definitions for restricting `g : B → ℕ → ℕ` to the preimage of a clopen set `C ⊆ ℕ → ℕ` in the codomain. These generalize the earlier `gRestrDom`/`gRestrFun` (first-coordinate partition) to arbitrary clopen subsets.
   - `gClopenFun_continuous` / `gClopenFun_scattered` — The restricted function inherits continuity and scatteredness.
   - `extract_B_map` — From a `ContinuouslyReduces` to `gClopenFun`, extracts a B-valued forward map σ with `g(σ x) ∈ C` and an inverse τ. (Proved.)
   - `exists_disjoint_clopen_with_cofinal_ranks` — **Key Lemma (sorry'd)**: For limit η with `CBRank g = η`, and any cofinal sequence δ below η, produces pairwise disjoint clopen subsets `C_n` of `ℕ → ℕ` and an injection `p` such that `CBRank(gClopenFun B g (C_{p(n)})) > δ_n`. This is the "tree argument" from the memoir.
   - `gluing_via_codomain_partition` — **Combination Lemma (sorry'd)**: Given reductions from each `MaxDom(enumBelow η n)` to `gClopenFun B g (C_{p(n)})`, combines them into `MaxFun η ≤ g`.

2. **`PointedGluing/GeneralStructure.lean`** (modified) — The proof of `MaxFun_le_limit_rank` now:
   - Decomposes each `enumBelow η n = α'_n + m_n` and computes `δ_n = α'_n + 2*m_n < η`.
   - Calls `exists_disjoint_clopen_with_cofinal_ranks` with `δ` to get the clopen partition and injection.
   - For each n, chains `MaxFun(enumBelow η n) ≤ MinFun(α'_n + 2*m_n) ≤ gClopenFun B g (C_{p(n)})` using `MaxFun_le_MinFun` and `minFun_is_minimum`.
   - Combines via `gluing_via_codomain_partition`.
   - **No `sorry` remains in GeneralStructure.lean.**

### What remains (2 `sorry`s in `MaxFunLimitRank.lean`)

1. **`exists_disjoint_clopen_with_cofinal_ranks`** — The tree argument. The mathematical approach: use `C_k = {h | h 0 = k}` (first-coordinate partition), the existing `gRestrFun_CBRank_cofinal` for cofinality, and a greedy injection construction from infinite sets of indices with high CBRank.

2. **`gluing_via_codomain_partition`** — The combination lemma. The mathematical approach: define σ by pasting the block-wise σ_B maps using the GluingSet structure, define τ by pasting `prepend k ∘ τ_k` on each C(p k)-piece of the codomain, verify equation via `prepend_unprepend`.

Both lemmas are mathematically correct and well-delineated, but require ~100-200 lines each of careful type-level formalization involving continuous pasting, homeomorphisms between restriction types, and GluingSet manipulation.

## Summary of work on `MaxFun_le_limit_rank`

### What was accomplished

I made significant progress on the infrastructure needed to prove `MaxFun_le_limit_rank` in `PointedGluing/GeneralStructure.lean`, though the core lemma remains unproven (1 `sorry`).

**New infrastructure added to `GeneralStructure.lean`:**

1. **`gRestrDom` / `gRestrFun`** — Definitions for restricting `g : B → ℕ → ℕ` to the preimage of `{h | h 0 = k}`, viewed as a `Set (ℕ → ℕ)` with an associated function. This allows applying `minFun_is_minimum` to codomain-restricted functions.

2. **`gRestrFun_continuous`** — The restricted function is continuous (proved directly).

3. **`gRestrFun_scattered`** — The restricted function is scattered, proved via `ContinuouslyReduces.scattered` (proved directly).

4. **`gRestrFun_CBLevel_union_empty`** — If `CBLevel (gRestrFun B g k) β = ∅` for all `k`, then `CBLevel g β = ∅`. Proved using `CBLevel_open_union_empty` and `CBLevel_homeomorph`.

5. **`gRestrFun_CBRank_cofinal`** — For each `γ < η = CBRank g`, there exists `k` with `CBRank (gRestrFun B g k) > γ`. Proved by contraposition using items 3 and 4.

**File `MaxFunLimitRank.lean`** was simplified to a stub (the proof work is in `GeneralStructure.lean`).

### What remains (`MaxFun_le_limit_rank` — 1 sorry)

The core `MaxFun_le_limit_rank` lemma remains unproven. This is the "tree argument" for the limit case of the General Structure Theorem: showing `MaxFun(η) ≤ g` when `η` is a limit ordinal and `CBRank g = η`.

**Why it's hard:** The proof requires finding countably many pairwise disjoint clopen sets `C_n ⊆ ℕ → ℕ` such that `CBRank(g|_{g⁻¹(C_n)})` is large enough, then combining individual reductions via a gluing construction. The difficulty is that a simple first-coordinate partition `{h | h 0 = k}` may concentrate all CB rank in a single block (when all outputs share the same first coordinate). The full proof requires iteratively refining the partition using longer prefixes (the "tree argument"), which involves substantial combinatorial infrastructure.

**Suggested approach for completion:** Implement the BaNbhd-based tree argument from the mathematical proof sketch in the docstring, handling two cases: (a) infinite body (finding pairwise incomparable sequences with `CBRank = η`), and (b) finite body (frontier elements with cofinal CB ranks). This requires ~200-300 additional lines of formalization.

I resolved 2 out of 3 `sorry`s in `RequestProject/PointedGluing/GeneralStructure.lean`:

1. **`exists_injection_above_targets`** (line 48): Fully proved. This lemma constructs an injective function `p : ℕ → ℕ` such that for a given sequence of ordinals below a limit ordinal η, `β n ≤ cofinalSeq η (p n)` for all n. The proof uses the surjectivity of `enumBelow` and an infinite pigeonhole argument.

2. **`MaxFun_le_MinFun`** (including the limit base case previously in `MaxFun_le_MinFun_limit`): Fully proved. This is the core inequality `MaxFun(η + n) ≤ MinFun(η + 2n)`, proved by well-founded induction on η and regular induction on n. The limit base case was restructured to be inlined within the well-founded induction, using `gluing_reduces_to_pgluing_via_injection` to combine block-wise reductions with `MinFun_monotone` for the monotonicity step.

3. **`MaxFun_le_limit_rank`** (line 154): **Remains as `sorry`**. This is the tree argument: showing `MaxFun(η) ≤ g` for a limit ordinal η when `CBRank g = η`. This lemma requires a deep combinatorial argument involving:
   - Constructing a tree of finite sequences in ℕ^{<ℕ} based on CB-ranks of restrictions to neighborhoods
   - Analyzing whether the body of the tree is infinite or finite
   - Finding pairwise incomparable elements with cofinal ranks
   
   The challenge is that combining per-block reductions from `GluingSet` to a single function `g` requires ensuring disjoint output ranges — which necessitates the tree argument to find appropriate clopen pieces in the output space. This infrastructure (tree bodies, frontier sets, etc.) is not currently available in the project and would require substantial new formalization.

**Impact on the main theorem**: The `general_structure_theorem` has two items:
- **Item 2** (CBRank f = η + n, CBRank g ≥ η + 2n + 1 → f ≤ g): Fully proved, does not depend on `MaxFun_le_limit_rank`.
- **Item 1** (CBRank g = η, CBRank f ≤ CBRank g → f ≤ g): Proved for η = 0; for η limit, depends on `MaxFun_le_limit_rank` (the remaining sorry).

## Progress on `general_structure_theorem`

I made significant progress resolving the sorry in `general_structure_theorem` from `PointedGluing/Theorems.lean`. The corrected theorem (in `PointedGluing/GeneralStructure.lean`) was already structured with helper lemmas by the previous agent. I resolved 4 of the 7 remaining sorry'd lemmas and added structure for the remaining 3.

### Fully Resolved (sorry-free)

**`PointedGluing/GeneralStructureHelpers.lean`** is now completely sorry-free. The key accomplishments:

1. **`pgl_tau_continuousOn`** — Proved the ContinuousOn property for the backward map τ' in pointed gluing functoriality. Decomposed into ContinuousWithinAt at zeroStream (using `continuousWithinAt_tau_at_zeroStream` with singleton block indexing) and at non-zeroStream points (using `continuousWithinAt_tau_at_block` with block-local continuous functions). This unblocked the entire chain: `pgl_functorial_val` → `MaxFun_le_MinFun_succ`.

2. **`gluing_reduces_to_pgluing_via_injection`** — Proved that given individual reductions A(n) ≤ B(p(n)) via an injective p, the whole GluingSet A reduces to PointedGluingSet B. Decomposed into 5 helper lemmas:
   - Forward map σ' sends block n of GluingSet to block p(n) of PointedGluingSet
   - Continuity via clopen block decomposition (each block is a fixed continuous composition)
   - Range analysis shows stripZerosOne maps into the right range (using injectivity of p)
   - Backward map τ' is ContinuousOn via `continuousWithinAt_tau_at_block`
   - Equation verified using `firstNonzero_prependZerosOne`, `stripZerosOne_prependZerosOne`, `Function.leftInverse_invFun`

### Remaining Sorries (3 in `PointedGluing/GeneralStructure.lean`)

1. **`exists_injection_above_targets`** (line 48) — Combinatorial lemma: for any sequence β(n) < η (countable limit ordinal), there exists an injective p : ℕ → ℕ with β(n) ≤ cofinalSeq η (p(n)). This is a countable selection argument using surjectivity of enumBelow.

2. **`MaxFun_le_MinFun_limit`** (line 54) — Base case: MaxFun(η) ≤ MinFun(η) for limit η. Uses `exists_injection_above_targets`, `gluing_reduces_to_pgluing_via_injection`, ordinal decomposition, `MaxFun_le_MinFun` at smaller ordinals, and `MinFun_monotone`.

3. **`MaxFun_le_limit_rank`** (line 86) — Tree argument: MaxFun(η) ≤ g when CBRank(g) = η for limit η. Each block reduces to g via minFun_is_minimum and the base case.

These are the deepest mathematical lemmas in the proof, requiring sophisticated ordinal combinatorics and transfinite induction arguments. The proof infrastructure is fully set up — resolving these 3 sorries would complete the entire `general_structure_theorem`.

# Progress on General Structure Theorem

## Overview

The task is to resolve the `sorry` in `general_structure_theorem` from `PointedGluing/Theorems.lean`.

The previous agents identified issues with the original theorem statement and created a corrected version in `PointedGluing/GeneralStructure.lean`. The corrected `general_structure_theorem` is proved modulo deep helper lemmas.

## Files Modified

15. **`gluing_reduces_to_pgluing_via_injection`** — Gluing of reductions with injection

### `PointedGluing/GeneralStructure.lean` — 3 remaining `sorry`

The main theorem `general_structure_theorem` is proved modulo 3 helper lemmas:

1. **`exists_injection_above_targets`** (line 48) — Combinatorial: for any sequence β(n) < η (limit), there exists an injective p : ℕ → ℕ with β(n) ≤ cofinalSeq η (p(n)). This is a countable selection/injection argument.

2. **`MaxFun_le_MinFun_limit`** (line 54) — Base case: MaxFun(η) ≤ MinFun(η) for limit η. This uses `exists_injection_above_targets` and `gluing_reduces_to_pgluing_via_injection` with the ordinal decomposition of each enumBelow η n, then `MaxFun_le_MinFun` at smaller ordinals, and `MinFun_monotone` to match target blocks.

3. **`MaxFun_le_limit_rank`** (line 86) — Tree argument: MaxFun(η) ≤ g when CBRank(g) = η for limit η. Each block MaxFun(enumBelow η n) reduces to g via decomposition and minFun_is_minimum.

## What Was Proved in This Session

Starting from 4 sorries (in the previous agent's state), this session:

- **Resolved `pgl_tau_continuousOn`** — by decomposing into ContinuousWithinAt at zeroStream (using `continuousWithinAt_tau_at_zeroStream`) and at non-zeroStream points (using `continuousWithinAt_tau_at_block`). This unblocked the chain: `pgl_functorial_val` → `MaxFun_le_MinFun_succ` (all now sorry-free).

- **Resolved `gluing_reduces_to_pgluing_via_injection`** — by decomposing into:
  - `unprepend_mem_of_gluingSet` (membership)
  - `gluing_to_pgluing_sigma_cont` (forward map continuity via clopen block decomposition)
  - `gluing_sigma_range_block` (range analysis using injectivity of p)
  - `gluing_to_pgluing_tau_cont` (backward map ContinuousOn via `continuousWithinAt_tau_at_block`)
  - Equation verification using `firstNonzero_prependZerosOne`, `stripZerosOne_prependZerosOne`, `Function.leftInverse_invFun`

- **Added `exists_injection_above_targets`** — helper for the limit base case.
